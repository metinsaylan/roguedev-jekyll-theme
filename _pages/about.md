Hi! I am a *Naval Architect* with a special interest on *[Software Development](/projects/)*. I am living in *Istanbul*, working as a *Solution Consultant* in a private Software Development Company.

In my personal life, if I am not in front of a computer, I love going out with my beautiful wife Ceren, watching movies and TV shows together. One other thing I like most, is [rambling](/) about coding, modelling, reviews and wise quotes.
