Here you can find more information about [Adsense Widget for WordPress](/projects/wordpress/adsense-widget/) usage.

### Adsense ID

This is your unique adsense id given by google. You can see your adsense id on top right corner of Google Adsense Panel. It is a number startin with "pub-". For this field you need to enter "pub-" in front of your id.

### Title

Title is shown before the widget. Its display is theme dependent. It displays as widget title.

### Ad Type

Adsense widget supports all the ad types provided by Google Adsense. (See : <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/AdFormats.html" target="blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Available ad formats</a>)

### Slot Id

Slot id defines adsense visual elements of your ad unit. After you create a new adsense unit with the current Google Adsense generator, it is embedded inside the code.

{% include img.html img_src="/2010/10/sample-generated-adsense-code.jpg" width="560" height="306" %}

{% include img.html img_src="/2010/11/adsense-slot-id.png" width="560" height="246" %}

Slot id stores color, size, font &amp; corners options. If you specify a <strong>slot id</strong> for the ad you have added, it will get all those settings from the ad you created.

One great advantage of using slot id is that, if you change the colors from <strong>Manage Ads</strong> panel in Â Google Adsense control panel, color scheme will be updated on all ad units using same slot id.

### Channel Id

Channel id allows you track reports of your adsense units. Every channel displayed seperately on adsense reports. You can see your top channels on Reports Overview.

{% include img.html img_src="/2010/11/adsense-channel-id.png" width="560" height="317" %}

It is good practice to use definitive channel names like: ShailanComSidebar OR ShailanComTopBanner.
