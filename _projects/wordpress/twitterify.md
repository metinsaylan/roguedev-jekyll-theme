This plugin automatically converts hashtags (like #wordpress) to tag links, @ links to author links (like @shailan), and autolinks URIs (like [http://shailan.com] ) to links. Some benefits of Twitterify are:

  * Linking will take less time, you will get more productive.
  * Tag links will be fine even if you change tag permalinks later on.
  * All links in the content will automatically have <strong>nofollow</strong> attributes.
